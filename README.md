### ☀️Summary 
I used to develop telegram bots: the last project was for the university in terms of attendance and student interaction. I study ml and dl, currently NLP, or rather LLM. I participate in hackathons, go to conferences and mock interviews.

### 🐘Education
[NUST MISIS](https://misis.ru/) | Moscow | BS | Computer Science | 2022-2026

### 🛠 Hard Skills
Python, PyTorch, Aiogram, Sklearn, NLTK, Transformers, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Hugging Face, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Gensim, CatBoost, FAISS, Git, Linux, Apache Airflow, Docker, MLFlow, PostgreSQL, Yandex Cloud

### 💼 Experience
**T-Bank (ex Tinkoff)**, NLP Engineer, Intern | May 2023 - Present
* I specialize in developing AI assistants powered by LLM specifically tailored for specific domain. My work covers the entire process — from analyzing domain-specific requirements and designing customized solutions to implementing and training/fine-tuning models. I create intuitive interfaces, adapt models to handle specialized functions, and ensure seamless integration with existing systems. By explaining complex technical aspects in simple terms, I help clients easily understand and implement effective solutions.
